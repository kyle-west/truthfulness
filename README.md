# truthfulness
This is a Truth Table Generator I am making for fellow students to use in my Discrete Math Class. [You may access it here](https://kyle-west.github.io/truthfulness)

## Example

Lets evaluate the expression: `p ∧ ¬q`. The Truth Table Generator will result with the following table.

```
| p | q | ¬q | p∧¬q |
|---+---+----+------|
| 0 | 0 | 1  |  0   |
| 0 | 1 | 0  |  0   |
| 1 | 0 | 1  |  1   |
| 1 | 1 | 0  |  0   |
```

We can also view the table with the results inline to the expression (accessed via the settings menu) like so:

```
| p | ∧ | ¬ | q |
|---+---+---+---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
```

If we wish, we may also change out the 1/0's for T\F's in the settings menu.

```
| p | ∧ | ¬ | q |
|---+---+---+---|
| F | F | T | F |
| F | F | F | T |
| T | T | T | F |
| T | F | F | T |
```
